              <p className="desc">
                Within the context of this document, “Personal Information”
                pertains to information that can identify a user or, given the
                context, could be leveraged to identify a user. Such information
                can be actively provided by you or passively collected by our
                systems. However, aggregated data, which cannot reasonably
                pinpoint an individual user, is not considered Personal
                Information.

                We only become privy to Personal Information like names, email
                addresses, health records, physical addresses, telephone
                numbers, demographic details, etc., when users voluntarily
                provide them. Examples include service registration, feedback,
                contest entries, or service usage. We may consolidate Personal
                Information with other data we collect from different sources.{" "}
                <br /> <br />
                Routine server operations record non-personal details of users,
                capturing aspects like the operating system (e.g., iOS, Android,
                Windows) and browser type (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Our
                systems also maintain log files that log data like IP addresses,
                browser type, service provider details, timestamps, and user
                navigation patterns.
                <br /> <br />
                Moreover, we employ various technologies, such as cookies and
                web beacons, to gather Personal Information. Primarily, cookies
                enhance user experiences by preserving their preferences.
                Furthermore, we might track location data linked to your IP
                address or, with your consent, the GPS or Bluetooth data from
                your mobile device. If you modify these settings on your device,
                some app functionalities may become unavailable.
                <br /> <br />
                Mainly, we use this data to elevate the user experience. Other
                applications of this data include internal reviews of user
                numbers but in non-personal, aggregated formats.

                We may share Personal Information with entities termed
                “authorized recipients', but this is exclusively within the
                boundaries of this Privacy Policy’s objectives. This might
                involve understanding user patterns, addressing user-specific or
                legal queries, sending notifications, safeguarding our site and
                services, processing membership applications, verifying credit
                card transactions, or overseeing legal and insurance claims. In
                some instances, with due legal permissions, we might share your
                data with regulatory bodies or other public entities.
                Furthermore, Personal Information might be populated through
                online forms linked to our Services.

                Upon feeding Personal Information on our platform, identifying
                technologies may enable the platform to “recall” your
                preferences, like frequently visited sections. This data might
                also be harnessed to introduce you to new service alerts, invite
                you to user surveys, or inform you of unique promotions. We
                maintain Personal Information only for a duration justified by
                its purpose—be it customer service, resolving queries, or
                addressing technical hitches. Exceptions might arise due to
                legal obligations or for establishing or defending legal
                stances.

                tools to accumulate non-identifiable data, opt-out choices for

                collection tools. For in-depth guidance on managing cookies or
