                You must have a valid prescription from a physician licensed to
                practice medicine and prescribe medications in the province or
                territory where you live. Please note that only your doctor can
                fax a prescription to City Pharmacy; pharmacy regulations
                stipulate that a pharmacy can accept a faxed prescription only
                from a physician’s office.
                <br /> <br />
                City Pharmacy accepts prescriptions transferred from your old
                pharmacy. If you provide us with the name and contact
                information of your old pharmacy, as well as the names of the
                medications you filled there, we will coordinate the transfer
                for you. City Pharmacy also accepts prescriptions sent to our
                office by mail. To save time, you can use the Site to take a
                picture of your prescription and submit it directly to us. We
                will send you a prepaid, priority envelope to mail us your
                prescription since we cannot ship your medication without a
                physical copy of your prescription. We use the picture to sort
                and package your medication ahead of time so your medication is
                ready to ship as soon as we receive your prescription in the
                mail.
                <br /> <br />
                If your prescription changes, have your doctor fax it directly
                to City Pharmacy, and we will update your file.
                <br /> <br />
                City Pharmacy fills prescriptions by the dose in SmartPacks. You
                can order up to 30 days’ worth of your prescription medication,
                which can be refilled in 30-day increments until you reach the
                end of your prescription. Your SmartPacks will also contain 30

                Like most pharmacies, City Pharmacy dispenses generic medication
                when appropriate and permitted by the prescribing doctor.
                Generic medications are just as safe and effective as brand-name
                medications. All prescription drugs are reviewed by Health
                Canada against federal guidelines and as such, the generic drug
                must include the same amount of medicinal ingredients as branded
                drugs. Although the non-medicinal ingredients may differ, the
                generic drug manufacturer must perform studies showing that the
                non-medicinal ingredients do not change the drug’s safety,
                quality, or effectiveness.

                When City Pharmacy fills your medications, we keep your best
                interests at heart and look for alternative medications that
                provide you with the lowest cost without compromising your
                health. For example, price reductions are often seen through
                therapeutic substitution, which can mean switching one
                medication for a chemically or therapeutically equivalent drug
                that can provide the same health benefits.

                If you have refills of your medications at another pharmacy,
                submit a transfer request of your prescription from the other
                pharmacy to City Pharmacy. You can submit a transfer request
                through the Site or by phone.
                <br /> <br />
                When your prescription is due for a refill, City Pharmacy will
                notify you by phone or Electronic Communication based on the
                preference you indicated when you created your Account. When you
                receive a refill notification, access the Site and you will be
                shown how much medication you have left on your prescription and
                be given the option to refill your prescription, which will be
                shipped to you directly. When you are running out of refills,
                City Pharmacy will contact your doctor (when available) to get a
                new prescription. We will notify you promptly if we run into any
                issues with renewal.

                If you need to refill a prescription early, are planning on
                travelling or going on vacation, call our office and let us know
                the dates you will be away at your earliest convenience.
                Occasionally, you may experience higher costs when requesting an
                early fill or vacation supply. However, we will work with your
                insurance provider to maximize the coverage of your medications
                – contact our office by phone, email, or through our in-app chat

                City Pharmacy advises you to always follow your doctor’s
                instructions for taking your medication: take the prescribed
                amount of the medication you should take for the prescribed
                length of time you should take it. This is the best thing you
                can do to make sure you get the full benefits from your
                medication and prevent additional health complications. We
                understand that some medications may have unpleasant side
                effects or be difficult to administer, and that is why City
                Pharmacy pharmacists are available to offer clinical advice when
                dealing with these issues.

                City Pharmacy is fully accredited and licensed through its
                provincial College, Association, or Society. City Pharmacy only

                child-resistant container is not suitable due to the physical

                the use of the Site, Content or Services (collectively, the
                “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that
                each party retains the right to (i) bring an individual action
                in an applicable small claims court, such as the Ontario
                Provincial Court (Small Claims Division) in respect of any
                dispute relating to City Pharmacy Inc., if the action is within
                the jurisdiction of that court and (ii) seek injunctive or other
                equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
                actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation
                of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or
                other intellectual property rights (the “Excluded Disputes”).
                Without derogating from or excusing your obligations under this
                section, we have the right (but not the obligation), in our sole
                discretion, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any
                matter which is subject to an Excluded Dispute. The provisions
                of this paragraph will survive any termination of this
