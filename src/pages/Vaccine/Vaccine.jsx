                      Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a nerve and skin infection
                      stemming from the varicella-zoster virus. Often impacting
                      those over 50, it can affect anyone who's had chickenpox.
                      We recommend administering the shingles vaccine for
                      individuals 50 and older in two doses for optimal
                      protection.

                      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a sexually
                      transmitted virus, can result in genital warts and several
                      cancers. Contracted through various intimate contacts,
                      it's a concern for many. We advocate the HPV vaccine for
                      those aged 9 to 45, typically administered to grade 6 or 7
                      students. Once vaccinated, no boosters are required.

                    Streptococcus pneumoniae is a potent bacteria responsible
                    for causing conditions like pneumonia. This bacteria spreads
                    easily, especially when an infected person coughs or when
                    one touches their face with unwashed hands. While children
                    are typically vaccinated against this threat, it's crucial
                    for adults, especially those over 65, to consider a booster
                    dose. Additionally, adults with weakened immune systems
                    might require further doses to ensure their safety.
